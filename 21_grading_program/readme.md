# Grading Program

We have access to a database of `student_scores` in the format of a dictionary. The **keys** in `student_scores` are the **names** of the students and the **values** are their exam **scores**.

This program **converts their scores to grades**. We create a new dictionary called `student_grades` that contains student **names** for **keys** and their **grades** for **values**.


This is the scoring criteria:

> Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
>
> Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
>
> Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
>
> Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
