# FizzBuzz

This program automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

- This program prints each number from `1` to `100` in turn.
- When the number is divisible by `3`, then instead of printing the number it prints `Fizz`.
- When the number is divisible by `5`, then instead of printing the number it prints `Buzz`.
- And if the number is divisible by both `3` and `5` e.g. `15` then instead of the number it prints `FizzBuzz`.
