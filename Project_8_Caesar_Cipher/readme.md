# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.


### Encryption Input Example

> Type your message:
> 
> `hello`
> 
> Type the shift number:
> 
> `5`


### Encryption Output Example

> The encoded text is `mjqqt`


### Decryption Input Example

> Type your message:
> 
> `mjqqt`
> 
> Type the shift number:
> 
> `5`


### Encryption Output Example

> The decoded text is `hello`
