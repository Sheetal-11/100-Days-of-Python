# BMI Calculator 2.0

This program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height. It also tells them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

We enter weight in kg and height in m.

### BMI Formula

$$ 
BMI = \frac{weight^2}{height} 
$$

### BMI Interpretation

| BMI Value | Category |
| :-------: | -------- |
| $\text{BMI} < 16$ | Underweight (Severe thinness) |
| $16 <= \text{BMI} < 17$ | Underweight (Moderate thinness) |
| $17 <= \text{BMI} < 18.5$ | Underweight (Mild thinness) |
| $18.5 <= \text{BMI} < 25$ | Normal range |
| $25 <= \text{BMI} < 30$ | Overweight (Pre-obese) |
| $30 <= \text{BMI} < 35$ | Obese (Class I) |
| $35 <= \text{BMI} < 40$ | Obese (Class II |)
| $40 <= \text{BMI}$ | Obese (Class III) |


### Example Input

> Enter your weight in kg: 55
> 
> Enter your height in m: 1.4

### Example Output

> Your BMI is 28.1, you are slightly overweight (pre-obese).
