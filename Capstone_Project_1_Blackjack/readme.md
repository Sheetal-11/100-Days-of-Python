# Blackjack Game

This is a single-player blackjack game where you compete against the computer.

## Objective of the Game

You attempt to beat the dealer (the computer) by getting a count as close to 21 as possible without going over 21.

- 2 through 10 cards count at face value, i.e. 2 counts as two, 9 counts as nine.
- Face cards (J, Q, K) count as 10.
- Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.

**You beat the dealer:**

1. when you draw a hand value higher than the dealerâ€™s hand value.
2. when the dealer draws a hand value that goes over 21.
3. when you draw a hand value of 21 on your first two cards when the dealer does not.

**You lose when:**

1. your hand value exceeds 21.
2. the dealer's hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round.
